	<h1>Concepts os Time, Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.Time complexity is the efficient way to know the time required for an algorithm  </p>
    <p>Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b>Space Complexity</b> of the algorithm.. For many inputs, constant c is insignificant, and it can be said that the space complexity is O(n).</p>
